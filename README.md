# Uncommon Firebase Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios in Firebase:

1. **Asynchronous Data Access Errors:** Errors that occur when accessing data from Firestore before it's fully loaded.  Improper handling of asynchronous operations can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
2. **Realtime Database Security Rule Issues:**  Poorly configured security rules can result in subtle errors that are difficult to diagnose.

The `bug.js` file contains code illustrating these issues. `bugSolution.js` provides corrected code with improved error handling and security rule suggestions.

## Setup

You'll need a Firebase project and credentials to run this code.  Refer to the Firebase documentation for setup instructions.
