The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This can happen if you attempt to read a field that doesn't exist or if you access the snapshot asynchronously without proper error handling. For example:

```javascript
db.collection('users').doc('someId').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().nonExistentField); // Error if the field does not exist
});
```
Another less common error occurs with Realtime Database security rules, where a poorly configured rule can cause unexpected behavior or crashes without informative error messages. For instance, a rule that isn't explicit enough might allow unauthorized access or completely deny legitimate operations, making debugging difficult.
